# 3D Sudoku (Tredoku) Solver
***A tool to help fans of 3D Sudoku/ Tredoku (as found in the Times) improve their solving skills.***

## Background and introduction 
At their simplest, Sudoku solving programs are demonstrative of the immense power of computing, outpacing even the best human solver. However, those who enjoy Sudokus recognise that their appeal lies in neither determining whether a solution exists, or in merely seeing that solution (after all, any valid Sudoku must be solvable and answers can typically be found in the next newspaper edition or the back of a puzzle book). The charm is instead found in the *process* of puzzling through the logic to uncover that solution. At their best, Sudoku solving programs are tools to assist with the hand-solving process, allowing users to check their solutions, obtain guidance when stuck and improve their understanding of more complex solving strategies. 

Many brilliant Sudoku solvers exist, as websites and projects hosted on GitHub or elsewhere, but the slightly more complex (from both puzzle-solving and coding perspectives) 3D Sudoku/ Tredoku hasn't been afforded this treatment. Having failed to find such a tool, I decided to create a 3D Sudoku solving program, designed to take in a user's Tredokus and visualise the application of Sudoku strategies used to find its solution.  

## Classic (2D) Sudoku Solver and 3D Sudoku (Tredoku) Solver
As the 3D version of Sudoku takes its underlying logic from the classic puzzle, programming a 2D Sudoku solver served as a useful initial step for the full project. This tool is by no means unique- impressive creations such as the [SudokuWiki solver](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sudoku.htm) boast highly developed GUIs and more advanced strategies- but my version of the 2D solver has been included for reference. In making it, I focused particularly on creating a clean, simple GUI which visualises the user's choice of solving strategies in an appealing and informative manner.
